# Python-Undefined-Behavior

Inspired from <https://github.com/satwikkansal/wtfpython>.

The names comes from C++ where the behavior of the program is hard to predict or being unpredictable,
this is usually has a syntax that trick the programmer to think in a certain way but the program does
something unexpected.
